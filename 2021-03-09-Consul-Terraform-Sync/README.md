Laying down some sweet notes over here

Here's the plan

Deploying an F5 LB in Azure
Deploy a VM running Consul, CTS, and Terraform
Deploy a VM running a basic web application
Register app with Consul
Have F5 open port 80 on LB to said APP using CTS

What do you need to do?

Step 1 - Enable programmatic deployment of the F5 Per-App Virtual Edition PAYG
Step 2 - Deploy the test environment from the environment directory
Step 3 - Check config of F5
Step 4 - Register application with Consul
Step 5 - Check config of F5

Install AS3 on F5
