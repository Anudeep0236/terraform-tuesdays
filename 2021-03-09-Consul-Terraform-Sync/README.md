Laying down some sweet notes over here

Here's the plan

Deploying an F5 LB in Azure
Deploy a VM running Consul, CTS, and Terraform
Deploy a VM running a basic web application

Step 1 - Enable programmatic deployment of the F5 Per-App Virtual Edition PAYG
Step 2 - Deploy the test environment from the environment directory
Step 3 - Check config of F5
Step 4 - Register application with Consul
